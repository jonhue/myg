# Myg

![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/myg.svg)
<img src="https://travis-ci.org/jonhue/myg.svg?branch=master" />

An opinionated & modular state-of-the-web framework.

**Disclaimer:** Myg really is a state-of-the-web framework. It utilizes CSS variables, CSS grid and ES6. Better be aware before throwing it around.

## Philosophy

**Modular:** Myg includes a lot of UI elements. Because everyone of them is separately published on NPM, you can just include what you actually use.

**Lightweight:** Mixins > Classes. Myg's CSS classes are entirely optional to minimize file size.

**Opinionated:** Opinionated components prevent you from polluting your DOM.

**Modern:** Myg uses the latest web technologies to support its rich feature set while remaining lightweight.
